# Software package

The software package part of Cert3D will be PC-based application.  It shall have the following features:

* Have USB interface to the Cert3D hardware board and be able to download information.

* (If possible) Interface with the printer directly to be able to send g codes and request status updates.

## File organization

* cert3d.py: this is the main file.

* ScopeResultsWindow.py: This file is generated by wxFormBuilder and is the layout of the window.

* ScopePanel.py: This is a custom widget to draw oscilloscope-type information on a panel.

* Channel.py: This hold information about a singl channel, either digital or analog.

* BilevelData.py: This holds data on a single channel of digital data.

* PlotData.py: This holds xy data on a single channel. 

### ScopePanel.py

This widget inherits from wx.Panel and nicely displays a number of channels on a form.  Data can either be bilevel or plot.

To add a channel, we use the `Add(data)` function where `data` is either (for now) `BilevelData` or `PlotData`.

#### Graphic layout

Channel names should be on the left-hand side of the widget.  Each channel can have a custom height, with the minimum height being the height of the channel name.

The width of the channel name display shall be fixed to the minimum possible size and recalculated when a new channel is added.

### ScopeChannel.py

This should hold aethestic information about the channel (color, height, scaling).  It will also do the drawing.
