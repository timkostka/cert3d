The GSL are Generic STM32F4 Libraries for various peripherals.  This is an
additional abstraction layer that makes use of the STM32 HAL libraries in a
way that is hopefully easier and more straightforward to use.

The GSL are header-only C++ libraries.  To use them, simply include the
"gsl_includes.h" file from a C++ source file.
