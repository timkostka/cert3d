# What is Cert3D?

Cert3D is a project designed to certify the performance of 3d printer firmware.  It works by sending test g-code to the printer and monitoring the output of stepper motors.

## Why is Cert3D?

Within the 3d printer firmware community, there is a lack of verification of software features.  A massive amount of man-hours is spent on tracking down bugs which could otherwise be detected automatically.  The aim of this project is to enable developers to ensure features are working as intended before releasing software.

## Who benefits?

For developers, the testing framework helps identify bugs quickly allowing them to be fixed quickly.  The improved software quality due to this benefits.
